# StackBlitz Docs

Welcome to the home of the [StackBlitz documentation site](https://developer.stackblitz.com)!

## What is StackBlitz?
StackBlitz is an **instant fullstack web IDE for the JavaScript ecosystem**. It's powered by [WebContainers](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/), the first WebAssembly-based operating system which **boots Node.js environment in milliseconds**, securely within your browser tab.

Now you can use the web to build the web.

## Development

There are three ways to interact with this repository:
- For **a small content update**, you can use [Web Publisher](#content-updates-with-web-publisher). 
- If you want **to explore and develop** this site, use [StackBlitz Codeflow](#developing-with-stackblitz-codeflow). 
- Alternatively, you can [run the docs locally](#developing-locally).

### Content updates with Web Publisher

Use Web Publisher for small content updates for a pleasant editing experience:

1. Open the page on our [docs site](developer.stackblitz.com), scroll down, and click "edit this page".
2. Update the document in the editor on the left and see the rendered change in the preview window on the right.
3. Once you're done, in the top right corner click on the green button that says "Propose changes".
4. You will be redirected to a GitHub PR template page prepared for you to submit a PR.


### Developing with StackBlitz Codeflow
Use StackBlitz Codeflow for bigger content updates. Codeflow will spin up the entire dev environment with a running dev server. To access it, [click this button](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/stackblitz/docs).

<!-- TODO add button -->

Alternatively, add “pr.new” to the beginning of this GitHub repo URL.

### Developing locally
You can also explore and develop this site locally.

After cloning the repository, run the docs site in development mode with:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

### Editor setup

We recommend the following extensions:

- Installing the [Vue Language Features extension (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar).
- Using [Volar’s Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471) (aka disabling the built-in TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features extension for the current workspace).
