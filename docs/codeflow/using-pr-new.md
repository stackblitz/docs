# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

This page covers using pr.new to open, view, and contribute to any project through our Codeflow IDE or Web Publisher.

Built to make open source contributions as easy as possible. ðŸ¥°

## How does pr.new work?

Behind the scenes, this short URL will choose different tools in different scenarios:

<!-- TODO: graph -->

### Opening a GitHub repository

To open a GitHub repository with pr.new, visit it on GitHub and in the browser's address tab, add `pr.new` to the beginning of the URL, for example:

> <a href="https://pr.new/github.com/stackblitz/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>pr.new/</b>github.com/stackblitz/docs</a>

You will be redirected to [Codeflow IDE](./working-in-codeflow-ide) where you can work to [submit a PR](./working-in-codeflow-ide#submitting-a-pr) or just explore the codebase.

### Opening a specific branch 

To inspect a branch with pr.new, visit it on GitHub and in the browser's address tab, add `pr.new` to the beginning of the URL, for example:

> <b>pr.new/</b>github.com/stackblitz/docs/tree/BRANCH-NAME

You will be redirected to [Codeflow IDE](./working-in-codeflow-ide) where you can explore the code, continue the work, or investigate the issue.

### Reviewing a PR

To review a PR with pr.new, visit the submitted pull request on GitHub and in the browser's address tab, add `pr.new` to the beginning of the URL, for example:

> <a href="https://pr.new/github.com/stackblitz/docs/pull/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>pr.new/</b>github.com/stackblitz/docs/pull/33</a>

You will be redirected to [Codeflow IDE](./working-in-codeflow-ide) in the ["PR review mode"](./working-in-codeflow-ide#reviewing-a-pr-with-codeflow-ide) where you will see diffs. You can switch to the standard file view by choosing the "file" icon in the left vertical nav bar.

## "Open in Codeflow" button

To help your users quickly spin up the entire environment with your project, you can add a CTA (call-to-action) button on your website or in the README file with any of the above pr.new links. 

| Button preview | Direct URL |
| --- | --- |
| <img alt="Open in Codeflow" src="/img/open_in_codeflow.svg" /> | <a href="/img/open_in_codeflow.svg" target="_blank">open_in_codeflow.svg</a> |
| <img alt="Open in Codeflow" src="/img/open_in_codeflow_small.svg" /> | <a href="/img/open_in_codeflow_small.svg" target="_blank">open_in_codeflow_small.svg</a> |

::: tip
You can either host the images on your servers or directly use our image URLs.
:::

In order to display the button in a **Markdown file**, use the following code - remember to update the last URL with the project repository path:

```md
[![Open in Codeflow](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_codeflow.svg)](https:///pr.new/___GH_ACCOUNT__/___GH_REPOSITORY___)
```

Or, in HTML:

```html
<a href="https:///pr.new/___GH_ACCOUNT__/___GH_REPOSITORY___">
  <img
    alt="Open in Codeflow"
    src="https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_codeflow.svg"
  />
</a>
```

If the user is logged in at GitHub and StackBlitz (in beta), Codeflow IDE will open up. No further configuration is needed. 

## Opening a single file

To edit a single file with pr.new, visit it in the GitHub repository and click the "Edit" icon (a pencil). Now, in the browser's address tab, add `pr.new` to the beginning of the URL, for example:

> <a href="https://pr.new/github.com/stackblitz/docs/edit/main/docs/guides/user-guide/what-is-stackblitz.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>pr.new/</b>github.com/stackblitz/docs/edit/main/docs/guides/user-guide/what-is-stackblitz.md</a>

You will be redirected to [Web Publisher](./content-updates-with-web-publisher) for a more pleasant editing experience. If you prefer to work in a full environment, click on the "Open in IDE" button and you will be redirected to [Codeflow IDE](./working-in-codeflow-ide).
