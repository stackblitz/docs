# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Based off the root DNS zone set in EE Site Configuration (for instance, `stackblitz.example.com`), set the following DNS `A` records to point at your instance's IP (`172.16.4.20` in this example):

```
A stackblitz.example.com 172.16.4.20
A *.stackblitz.example.com 172.16.4.20
A *.preview.stackblitz.example.com 172.16.4.20
```

## TLS

For TLS, your certificate should have `stackblitz.example.com` as the Common Name (CN), and the following Subject Alternative Name (SAN's):

- `stackblitz.example.com`
- `*.stackblitz.example.com`
- `*.preview.stackblitz.example.com`

### TLS Certificate Renewal

Having trouble renewing your TLS cert? Follow these instructions (extracted from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/vaxinate/6388e56f08b9dc710133ef82d1d78e95)):

1. SSH into your StackBlitz host VM
2. Retrieve the existing StackBlitz application certificate and key via `â€‹kubectl get secret -o jsonpath={.data} stackblitz-tls-secret`
3. Create a new yaml file on the host VM called new-kotsadm-tls.yaml based on [this template](https://gist.github.com/vaxinate/ff4b143b8363a9f68f8f4cba400d9508).
4. Replace the stringData.hostname field with your existing stackblitz hosted zone (ex: `stackblitz.[COMPANY].com`). This DNS name should already be configured properly for your instance.
5. Replace the data."tls.crt" and data."tls.key" with the values you retrieved in step 2. Be sure to copy these values exactly as single lines without adding additional whitespace.
6. Save new-kotsadm-tls.yaml
7. Back up the existing self-signed cert via `kubectl get secret -o yaml kotsadm-tls > old-kotsadm-tls.yaml`.
8. Delete the old self-signed certificate via `kubectl delete secret kotsadm-tls`.
9. Apply the new cert via `kubectl apply -f new-kotsadm-tls.yaml`.
10. Visit the dashboard by navigating to the hostname you entered in step 4 on port 8800 (ex: `https://stackblitz.COMPANY.com:8800`).
