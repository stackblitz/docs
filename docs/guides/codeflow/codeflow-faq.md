## Features

### Can I run Vim?

This is perhaps the most frequently-asked question with regards to StackBlitz features - and [one of the oldest issues on our repository](https://github.com/stackblitz/core/issues/3). We have good news. You can run Vim now. Enable the extension in Codeflow and experience the escape room that is Vim.

### Which package managers do you support?

<!--@include: ./parts/supported-packages.md-->

### Which runtime does Codeflow support?

Just like WebContainers, Codeflow runs on Node.js 16.

### Is Codeflow stable?
It is in the beta version available through the [early access program](ADD LINK). It will enter general availability in early 2023.

### Do I have to be signed in to use Codeflow IDE? 

Yes, only during the beta. Starting Q1 2023, you'll be able to open public repos without being logged in.

### Does my code persist between sessions?

<!--@include: ./parts/persistance.md-->

### What features are you planning to implement?

In the following months, we will focus on implementing the following features:
- **Codeflow IDE:**
    - **change persistance between sessions** - you will be able to close the page, close the browser, and your changes will still be there when you reconvene,
    - **multiplayer mode** - the best setup for pair-programming,
    - **private registries** enabled in the enterprise version,
- **Web Publisher:**
    - something,
- **CodeflowApp bot:**
    - something.

### Is multiplayer mode in the works?
Yes! Please check our list of [planned features](#what-features-are-you-planning-to-implement).

### Can I run private repositories?
<!-- TODO -->

## Security 

### I would like to use Codeflow but I'm not sure if it's secure.


## Pricing and access

### Is Codeflow free?
Codeflow IDE is free for Open Source projects and public repositories an will remain this way forever.
