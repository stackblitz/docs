This mode comes on when Web Publisher is viewed on Safari.

[Safari currently doesn't support WebContainers](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/cross-browser-with-coop-coep/), which is the technology at the basis of Web Publisher. 

That being said, you can still run Web Publisher and submit Pull Requests. In this mode, we show a rendered version of your markdown file instead of **WHAT????**.
