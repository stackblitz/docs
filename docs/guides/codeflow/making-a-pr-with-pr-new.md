# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

This page walks you through using pr.new to contribute to any Open Source project.

## What is pr.new?

<!--@include: ./parts/pr-new.md-->

## How does pr.new work?

Although initially planned to be a tool for enabling faster pull requests, pr.new can be used on any repository, issue, branch or a PR.

By replacing github.com with pr.new in the repository URL, you will open Codeflow with files ready to be edited. If the repository runs on WebContainers, a dev server will start so you can verify your changes in real time.

::: info
If you use pr.new on a GitHub URL with a filepath,  Web Publisher will open instead of Codeflow. You can still choose to open Codeflow by clicking on the "Open in IDE" button.
