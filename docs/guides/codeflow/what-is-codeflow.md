title: What is Codeflow?
---

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Codeflow is a one-click integration with GitHub for seamless coding workflows. 

<!-- ideally these would be tiles or something else with little gifs THAT START PLAYING ONLY WHEN HOVERED ON -->
StackBlitz now helps you switch contexts seamlessly:
- **Codeflow**: a fully fledged desktop-grade dev environment capable of running your whole workflow - from production-level dev work to reviewing pull requests
- **pr.new**: spin up a live environment to open any repository, contribute to any Open Source project, or view any PR by adding "pr.new"  to the beginning of the GitHub URL
- **Web Publisher**: edit your docs or blog with a live preview of the changes
- **StackBlitz staging bot**: a vigilant friend providing a one-click link to spin up a whole environment for pull requests and issues

Stay in your flow state.

## Key features
- **unmatched security**: all development is happening in your browser tab, including running Node.js, git, package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm), and local extensions.
- **shockingly fast**: the entire dev environment spins up in miliseconds - even reinstalling `node_modules` is as simple as refreshing the page, with pnpm running up to four times as fast as locally!
- **works online and offline**: continue your work even when you lose the Internet connection midway.
- **your environment is always online**: your apps never go to sleep and have no bandwidth limits - share the URL with as many friends, colleagues, and communities as youâ€™d like!
- **always free for Open Source**: you're the future of the web development and we love you.

## What about other online IDEs?

Unlike StackBlitz, legacy online IDEs run on remote servers and stream the results back to your browser. This approach yields **few security benefits** and **provides a worse experience** than your local machine in nearly every way.

**StackBlitz solves these problems by doing all computing inside your browser**. This leverages decades of speed and security innovations but also **unlocks key development and debugging benefits**.

Lastly, StackBlitz is capable of running Node.js inside the browser so you can use the web to build the web.
