<!--@include: ./parts/codeflow.md-->

StackBlitz now helps you switch contexts seamlessly:
- 💻 <!--@include: ./parts/codeflow-ide.md-->
- 📝 <!--@include: ./parts/web-publisher.md-->
- 🪄 <!--@include: ./parts/pr-new.md-->
- 🤖 <!--@include: ./parts/codeflowapp-bot.md-->


## Key features
- 🔒 **unmatched security**: all development is happening in your browser tab, including running Node.js, git, package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm), and local extensions.
- ⚡️ **shockingly fast**: the entire dev environment spins up in miliseconds - even reinstalling `node_modules` is as simple as refreshing the page, with pnpm running up to four times as fast as locally!
- 💻 **works online and offline**: continue your work even when you lose the Internet connection midway.
- 🔥 **your environment is always online**: your apps never go to sleep and have no bandwidth limits - share the URL with as many friends, colleagues, and communities as you’d like!
- 🆓 **always free for Open Source**: you're the future of the web development and we love you.

## What about other online IDEs?

Unlike StackBlitz, legacy online IDEs run on remote servers and stream the results back to your browser. This approach yields **few security benefits** and **provides a worse experience** than your local machine in nearly every way.

**StackBlitz solves these problems by doing all computing inside your browser**. This leverages decades of speed and security innovations but also **unlocks key development and debugging benefits**.

Lastly, StackBlitz is capable of running Node.js inside the browser so you can use the web to build the web.
