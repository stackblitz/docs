## What are starter projects?

Great question! Starter projects are online playgrounds, typically built by the core team of a given project and run on StackBlitz. They are used in project documentation or found under [a custom link](#framework-specific-starter). You can find some of them on our dashboard. Some open source projects provide a custom URL as a convenient starting point for their starter projects.
