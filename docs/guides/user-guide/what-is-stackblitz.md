# What is StackBlitz?

StackBlitz is an online IDE (integrated development environment) where you can create Angular, React, and Vue projects quickly and easily in your browser. It automatically takes care of installing dependencies, compiling, bundling, hot reloading as you type, and much more.

StackBlitz eliminates the stress of having to configure deployment and build tools before you can start coding a cool prototype or demo. StackBlitz will feel and function exactly like your local dev environment by providing separate windows for you to preview and debug live! Every project gets it's own unique URL and the option to rename your projects.

### Why Should I Use StackBlitz?

As an online IDE, user experience is key. In addition to the simplicity of spinning up projects, here are a few bullet points that make StackBlitz unique:

#### Share & embed
Every project can be shared with others to view/fork & also comes with a revolutionary embed view that puts the full power of VS Code in your Medium articles, blog posts, and docs.

#### Download & run locally
Clicking the “Export” button will download a ZIP file of your project configured to run with either create-react-app or @angular/cli (for React & Angular projects, respectively)

#### Your apps are always online
Your apps never go to sleep and have no bandwidth limits. Share the URL with as many friends, colleagues, and communities as you’d like!

#### Edit applications both small & large
StackBlitz is the only in-browser environment that can handle live editing “the mother of all demo apps”: [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) (view the [React](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-redux-realworld) and [Angular](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-realworld) implementations). TodoMVC, one of the most popular demo apps, [also runs smooth as butter](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-redux-todomvc).
