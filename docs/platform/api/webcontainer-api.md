# WebContainer API

WebContainer API allows for running WebContainers headlessly. It is currently in the pre-release alpha stage and accessed by invite only.

To see an example of the headless WebContainer in action, see the talk by Rich Harris about [building the new SvelteKit tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFah4QqiUAg&t=4581s) or explore [the tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) yourself.

Request your invitation through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSertiZLl-za0ZHxsWbd2IrISVft2OpPglykEHpEllPSfnZIUg/viewform).
