# Getting started

Discover how you can start using StackBlitz now!

## Picking a starter project

Let’s go to the [StackBlitz homepage](https://stackblitz.com/). If you are not logged in yet, don’t worry, you can scroll down a bit to find a list of starter projects to choose from:

If you _are_ logged in, you should see your personal dashboard with a very similar list of starter projects:

You can explore the different categories (“Popular”, “Frontend”, “Fullstack”, etc.) to find a technology stack that you’d like to try out.

Some frameworks also provide short URLs that you can use to create new StackBlitz projects. Check out [the list of “.new domains” here](/docs/platform/project-starters/#new-domains).

## Importing code

No starter project for your favorite framework?
Or do you want to import your own code?

Read more on [how to import projects](/docs/platform/importing-projects/) from your own files, or from GitHub repositories.

## Using the StackBlitz editor

Once you’ve clicked a starter project or imported a GitHub repository, you should see a fully working StackBlitz editor, which automatically compiles the project’s code to show a result on the right.

Learn more about [the different parts of the editor](/docs/platform/ide-whats-on-your-screen/).

You can now make code changes, and see live updates in the Preview on the right side!

If you’re not signed in yet, we recommend signing in with a GitHub account to make sure that you can save your changes and find them back later.

## Using StackBlitz on your site

If you’re writing a blog, maintaining a documentation site or an open-source project, you can use StackBlitz to:

1. [Embed examples and demos](/docs/platform/embedding/).
2. [Add “Open in StackBlitz” buttons](/docs/guide/open-from-github/) to your READMEs and docs.
3. [Generate custom projects on the fly](/docs/guide/create-with-sdk/) with our JavaScript SDK.
4. [Recommend StackBlitz in GitHub issue templates](/docs/guide/bug-reproductions/) to get better bug reproductions!
