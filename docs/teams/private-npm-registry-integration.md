To integrate with your private NPM registry you will first need to ensure that it is accessible from the internet, without needing to log into any proxies or VPNs. 

:::tip
If your registry is behind a corporate firewall, than you will likely need StackBlitz Enterprise installed behind the corporate firewall/on-prem in order to access your private NPM registry. For more information on Enterprise you can [reach out to sales here](https://stackblitz.com/enterprise-contact).
:::

If you can ping/access your registry without a proxy or firewall then you can follow these steps to connect it to your StackBlitz Teams plan, allowing all teammates access:

1. Gather your Registry URL & Access Token<br>
    These items can be found in your private npm registry server settings.

    - [Sonatype Nexus Documentation](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3)
2. Navigate to `https://stackblitz.com/orgs/github/[YOUR_ORG_NAME]/settings` and scroll to the bottom of the page
3. Click “Add new registry”
