Each StackBlitz Team must be linked in a 1:1 relationship with a corresponding [Github Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations). 

:::tip
In the future we plan to support additional version control providers & Teams creation pathways. If linking to a Github Org doesn’t work for you, please reach out and let us know how we can meet your team’s needs!

To create a StackBlitz Team:
1. Navigate to https://stackblitz.com/pricing
